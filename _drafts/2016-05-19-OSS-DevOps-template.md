**Directions for adding images**

1. Create a folder for your project images in the “images” folder in the GitHub repo files. This is where you will add all of the images associated with your write-up. 
2. Add links to your images using the following absolute path:

   `![Description of the image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/projectname/myimage.png)`

   Here’s an example: 

   `![Value stream mapping]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/orckestra/orckestra2.jpg)`

Note that capitalization of the file name and the file extension must match exactly for the images to render properly.
