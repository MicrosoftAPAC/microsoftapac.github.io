## Customer profile ##

This section will contain general information about the customer, including the following:

- Name and URL
- Description
- Location
- Product/service offerings
 
## Problem statement ##

This section will define the problem(s)/challenges that the customer wants to address with an Azure App Service solution. Include things like costs, customer experience, etc.
 
>If you’d really like to make your write-up pop, include a customer quote that highlights the customer’s problem(s)/challenges. Attribute all quotes with name, title, company.

## Solution, steps, and delivery ##

The majority of your win artifacts will be included in this section, including (but not limited to) the following: source code snippets, pictures, drawings, architectural diagrams, value stream mappings, and demo videos.

This section should include the following details:

- What was worked on and what problem it helped solve 
- Description of the web app you built and what it did. What was the web app function? How was it different and compelling? How did it help you do more than using something else?
- Technical details of how this was implemented
- Pointers to references or documentation 
- Learnings from the Microsoft team and the customer team
- Architecture diagram/s (**required**). Example below:

**Directions for adding images**

1. Create a folder for your project images in the “images” folder in the GitHub repo files. This is where you will add all of the images associated with your write-up. 
2. Add links to your images using the following absolute path:

   `![Description of the image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/projectname/myimage.png)`

   Here’s an example: 

   `![Value stream mapping]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/orckestra/orckestra2.jpg)`

Note that capitalization of the file name and the file extension must match exactly for the images to render properly.
