Microsoft teamed up with Gump Come, a provider of smart vending machines, to develop a way to monitor the working status of its machines and to get real-time information on replenishment needs. 

## Customer ##

[Gump Come](http://www.gumpcome.com/) is a leading AI innovation-oriented provider of smart vending machines and smart micro-supermarkets in China. These machines integrate the use of cameras, multi-touch, voice interaction, and big data analysis to realize new human-computer interaction patterns. 
 
## Pain point ##

To date, Gump Come has no solution that can monitor vending machine health status or get real-time information on whether a device is working. Any device needing attention usually requires two onsite visits—once to diagnose the issue and again to return with the component to fix the issue. All this adds to the cost of maintaining the machines.

The Gump Come goods manager must check on the selling status of the vending machines to see if they need replenishing. They want to develop an app for this. The goods manager will need training to learn to use the app. They want to get this information only through text or voice on the web app, and to reduce their cost of installing, learning, and updating the application. 
 
## Solution ##

1.	Use Azure IoT Hub to collect data on supplies and device health for all vending machines and send to the uniform management platform for daily monitoring. This will help the staff to diagnose device issues online, which can save on maintenance costs and help realize predictive maintenance cost savings.

2.	Based on Bot Framework and LUIS Services, build a vending machine management bot for an operator to check on vending machines and the status of their goods supply.

In this Smart Vending Machine solution, Gump Come will use the following Microsoft technologies: 

- Azure IoT Hub
- Stream Analytics
- Azure SQL Database
- Power BI
- Bot Framework

## Architecture ##

The Gump Come Smart Vending Machine solution architecture can be represented as follows:

- The Gump Come vending machine client will send its device status data to the Azure IoT Hub every 3 minutes. This data includes device status, goods channel status, and temperature. 

- Stream Analytics will transfer this data into three tables on Azure SQL Database, then Power BI will synch these table updates into the admin dashboard. 

- The Gump Come bot will offer voice and text query features to the operator to check the vending machine device status and goods channel status.

**Note:** Power BI is not generally available in China; Stream Analytics can't configure Power BI as an output stream in this phase.

## Device used and code artifacts ##

Microsoft's China DX Technical Evangelist team and the Gump Come dev team split the engagement into four segments:

- Vending machine IoT SDK integration
- Vending machine Azure IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, and Azure SQL Database deployment
- Data visualization in Power BI
- Vending machine administrator bot dev

### Vending machine IoT SDK integration ###

In this segment, the Gump Come team focused on vending machine client Azure IoT Hub SDK integration. The Gump Come vending machine client is the Android OS. The Microsoft DX team helped the Gump Come client dev team to code the Azure IoT Hub Android SDK in their client, set up and register the vending machine client with the Azure IoT Hub, connect with the Azure IoT Hub, and send vending machine device status data to the Azure IoT Hub. The Android client code screenshot is as follows:

```java

### Vending machine Azure IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, and Azure SQL Database deployment

In this segment, the Gump Come team deployed Azure IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, and Azure SQL Database on Azure. First, as a Gump Come proof of concept (POC) for Azure IoT Services, Gump Come created one free IoT Hub in their subscription, deployed Stream Analytics, and created their device status database on Azure SQL Database. Next, Gump Come technical decision makers, based on this POC result, plan to release this IoT solution to their 2,000+ production devices in China.

### Data visualization in Power BI ###

The Gump Come team presented their device status data and goods channel data through Power BI. They liked Power BI's excellent graphics and ease of use for the business operator. But because Power BI isn't generally available in China, we couldn't connect Stream Analytics directly with Power BI. Instead, the Gump Come team stored the data from Stream Analytics to Azure SQL Database, and used Power BI to connect to Azure SQL Database.

### Vending machine administrator bot dev ###

Here, the Gump Come team developed the [vending machine management bot](http://vendingmachinebotportalleon.azurewebsites.net/), which allows the vending machine operator to check the vending machine device status and goods status through a mobile phone.

## Opportunities going forward ##

As a result of this technical engagement, the Gump Come technical and business decision makers plan to roll out this IoT vending machine solution to all 2,000+ devices in China by the end of 2016, hosted entirely on Microsoft Azure. 

The Gump Come team will integrate the vending machine management bot app with Wechat in the coming months.

## Great team ##
