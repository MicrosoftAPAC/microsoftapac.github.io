excerpt: FINALDATA can restore data from accidental erase or lost digital camera/photo data. Restore data with enhanced search against data loss such as erasing the video data by mistake (digital camera), or if the SD card has become unreadable. OEM makers have been asking for a Windows Store version of FINALDATA, and hence there is now an urgent need to respond to this demand.

## Customer profile ##

The main business of [AOS DATA](http://www.aosdata.co.jp/), Inc. is the development and sale of utility software for the Windows operating systems. In particular, for 17 years straight in Japan, AOS DATA has been providing the No. 1 client PC data recovery software, "FINAL DATA", which has become the de facto standard for this application. Additionally, the company offers services such as data management and product services using security-related technologies, AOSBOX (cloud backup service), Risk Manager (data file erasing tool), and InCircle (Enterprise chat tool), among others.


## Problem statement ##

The various products from AOS DATA, Inc., including Final Data, are preinstalled on Windows PC OEM products. They urgently need to respond to OEM makers’ requests to develop a Windows Store version of the product. They are considering developing a universal Windows platform (UWP), but they anticipate that project would entail substantial man-hours and costs. A major challenge associated with system utility software is the need for system administration rights. 
**There are multiple technical challenges during conversion:**


1. The current installer cannot be converted to a UWP App using the Desktop App Converter. 
2. FINALDATA being a system utility required administrative privileges to run the app.
3. When using administrative privileges, desktop bridge security mechanism messages are displayed.


**To handle these issues, we took the following steps:**

## Solution, steps, and delivery ##

1. Held Hackfest (intensive technical implementation and coding session) for Desktop Bridge.
2. Discussed issues on running UWP App of FINALDATA.
3. Published UWP App to Windows Store.

### 1. Hackfest ###
In the Hackfest, the procedure was as follows:
- Discuss with users on how do get administrative privileges.
- Discuss with users on how to co-exist with desktop bridge security.
- In case of issues, discussed and decided on the steps to resolving them.
- As required, provide new sample code of script

**How to use Desktop App Converter:**  We provide [hands-on manual](https://github.com/shozoarai/DesktopBridgeSample/blob/master/Doc/Desktop Bridge Hands-on v 0.4 - English.pdf) and sample code.

3. **How do get administrative privileges?**  
We offer basic practice as separation of administrative privileges and lead user to launch as administrator’s right.
 
4. **Issue:**  
**How do exist together desktop bridge security?**  
We offer the specific technique, and make concept codes. By concept codes, we understood **"can exist together desktop bridge security"**.  So we provided new application structure as FINALDANAT launch procedure. Of course, **this methodology includes security risk. So we don’t publicize this concept code**.


### 3. Published UWP App to Windows Store ###
